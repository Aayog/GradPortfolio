                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi, I'm Aayog Koirala, an ambitious software developer currently pursuing my Master's in Computer
                    Science at Miami University, with an expected graduation in May 2024. I am proficient in various
                    programming languages, including C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL, and have hands-on
                    experience with frameworks and tools like Laravel, Node.js, Flask, Angular, Docker, S3, and Django.
                </p>
                <p>I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Miami University in 2022 and have taken a
                    wide range of courses in topics such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming,
                    and Software Engineering. For my capstone project, I led the development of a chatbot for the
                    university library using Google Dialogflow and Node.js.</p>
                <p>Throughout my academic journey, I've been actively involved in various projects, including developing
                    a scalable CMS website using Django REST Framework, experimenting with NLP using Spacy, and creating
                    user-friendly interfaces for games and utilities. My Python script, which tracks eye movements for
                    scrolling on social media sites, won an MLH-hosted hackathon at the University of Indianapolis in
                    2018.</p>
                <p>I've also gained valuable real-world experience through multiple roles at Miami University - Myaamia
                    Center, Community Health Network, and Cummins Inc. As a software developer, teaching assistant,
                    healthcare analytics intern, and IT intern, I've honed my technical and non-technical skills, making
                    me an ideal candidate for any software development role.</p>

                            <h4>Title: View Interpolation for 360° Panoramic Spherical Images Using Stitched Multiplane
                                Image Corridors
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Description: In this research project, we focus on developing a robust view
                                interpolation technique for
                                360°
                                panoramic spherical images by utilizing stitched multiplane image corridors. The primary
                                objective is to
                                enhance the visual experience of virtual reality and immersive environments by
                                generating smoother
                                transitions
                                between different viewpoints within the 360° scene.

                                To achieve this, we first create a corridor of multiplane images, which are derived from
                                the original
                                panoramic images by dividing them into multiple layers based on depth information. This
                                depth-based
                                segmentation enables us to represent the 3D structure of the scene more accurately,
                                allowing for better
                                handling of occlusions and parallax effects.

                                Next, we stitch these multiplane images together to form a continuous corridor that
                                encompasses the entire
                                360° scene. This step involves addressing challenges such as correcting misalignments,
                                blending image
                                seams,
                                and maintaining spatial consistency throughout the corridor.

                                Finally, we apply advanced machine learning algorithms to interpolate novel views within
                                the stitched
                                multiplane image corridor. These algorithms take into account both spatial and angular
                                information,
                                ensuring a
                                seamless transition between viewpoints while preserving the original scene's fidelity.

                                By employing this view interpolation method, we aim to provide an enhanced visual
                                experience in virtual
                                reality and immersive environments, where users can smoothly navigate through the 360°
                                scene with minimal
                                distortion or artifacts. This research has the potential to greatly impact applications
                                in industries such
                                as
                                gaming, tourism, and remote collaboration, where realistic and seamless immersion is
                                crucial for user
                                engagement and satisfaction.
