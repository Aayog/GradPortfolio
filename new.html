                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi, I'm Aayog Koirala, an ambitious software developer currently pursuing my Master's in Computer
                    Science at Miami University, with an expected graduation in May 2024. I am proficient in various
                    programming languages, including C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL, and have hands-on
                    experience with frameworks and tools like Laravel, Node.js, Flask, Angular, Docker, S3, and Django.
                </p>
                <p>I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Miami University in 2022 and have taken a
                    wide range of courses in topics such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming,
                    and Software Engineering. For my capstone project, I led the development of a chatbot for the
                    university library using Google Dialogflow and Node.js.</p>
                <p>Throughout my academic journey, I've been actively involved in various projects, including developing
                    a scalable CMS website using Django REST Framework, experimenting with NLP using Spacy, and creating
                    user-friendly interfaces for games and utilities. My Python script, which tracks eye movements for
                    scrolling on social media sites, won an MLH-hosted hackathon at the University of Indianapolis in
                    2018.</p>
                <p>I've also gained valuable real-world experience through multiple roles at Miami University - Myaamia
                    Center, Community Health Network, and Cummins Inc. As a software developer, teaching assistant,
                    healthcare analytics intern, and IT intern, I've honed my technical and non-technical skills, making
                    me an ideal candidate for any software development role.</p>
                <p>Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/aayog">LinkedIn</a> or explore my
                    projects on <a href="https://github.com/Aayog">GitHub</a>.</p>
